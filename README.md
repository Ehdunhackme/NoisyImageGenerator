# NoisyImageGenerator

This py script allows users to add different levels of noise to images. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can open an image file, adjust the noise parameters, and view the resulting noisy image.

## How does it work???
The noise applied on the image were generated by Gaussian noise, a type of random noise that follows a Gaussian distribution. Generating Gaussian noise involves randomly sampling values from this distribution where it can explained with the formula given below:

- x is the random variable.

- μ is the mean of the distribution.

- σ is the standard deviation of the distribution.

- π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159).

- This formula describes how the probability of observing a value x decreases as it moves away from the mean μ in both directions, with the rate of decrease controlled by the standard deviation σ.

## Application of gaussian noise


## Features

- Open image files in common formats (e.g., JPG, PNG).
- Adjust the noise scale to control the intensity of the noise added to the image.
- Optionally convert the image to grayscale before adding noise.
- Apply pixelation effect to the noisy image.
- View original and noisy images side by side in the GUI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included in standard Python distribution)
- NumPy
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Pillow (PIL)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages (`numpy`, `opencv-python`, `Pillow`) if you haven't already:
3. Run the `Main (NoisyImageGenerator).py` script:
4. Have fun experimenting with different settings :)
